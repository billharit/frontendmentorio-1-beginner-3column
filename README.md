## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn css positioning (relative and absolute) to position the button at the right place. using margin and padding would make the button go outside the div element during resizing the screen due to the text-width getting smaller so the text-line is increased.
